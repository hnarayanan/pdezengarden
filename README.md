# PDE Zen Garden

This project is inspired by a [wonderful little book](http://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/trefethen/pdectb.html) and aims to interactively demonstrate the beauty and utility of partial differential equations. The heavy-lifting behind the scenes is [powered by thinkbot](https://thinkbot.net/).
